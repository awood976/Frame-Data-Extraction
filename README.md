# Frame-Data-Extraction
A tool using Jupyter Notebook (Python) to enable a user to scan through an mp4 file frame by frame, and measure distances between clicks in the frame.

1) Begin by placing your mp4 video file in the same directory as the Extraction notebook file (or have the full directory name of the file). Assign this file name to the filename variable in the top cell. This is the video who's frames will be extracted.
